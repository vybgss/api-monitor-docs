    <h1>API Monitor - Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated: October 10, 2024</strong></p>

    <p>
      At <strong>API Monitor</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our macOS application, <strong>API Monitor</strong>, handles your data, specifically focusing on how we process and use the list of URLs you provide.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>API Monitor</strong> does not collect or store any personal data from your device. The application solely interacts with data that you manually provide, such as the list of URLs, to monitor API responses.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use the List of URLs</h2>

    <p>
      The list of URLs you enter into <strong>API Monitor</strong> is used exclusively for the purpose of checking the status and performance of those APIs. The URLs are stored locally on your device to enable continuous monitoring and to provide status updates for each URL. <strong>API Monitor</strong> does not transmit, share, or store the URLs or any data associated with them outside of your device.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Collection, Sharing, and Disclosure</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>API Monitor</strong> does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data. All information related to the URLs you provide is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers or third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <p>
      Since <strong>API Monitor</strong> operates entirely on your device, without transmitting data off your system, all URL data remains secure within your local environment. The app relies on macOS's built-in security features to ensure that the data is protected against unauthorized access.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>API Monitor</strong> does not integrate with or rely on any third-party services for its operation. The app functions independently on your device, ensuring that no external entities have access to the data you enter.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>API Monitor</strong> is designed for use by individuals of all ages and does not knowingly collect any personal information from users, including children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected or stored, the app complies with child privacy laws by design.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
    </p>
