      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2. What do the colors on the status squares mean?</strong><br />
        The colors represent the status of each URL: Green indicates a successful response, while Red indicates a failure or timeout.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>3. How often does API Monitor check the status of URLs?</strong><br />
        By default, API Monitor checks the status of URLs every 15 seconds, but this interval may be customizable in future versions.

      <li>
        <strong>4. What is the request timeout for API checks?</strong><br />
        API Monitor has a request timeout of 5 seconds. If a URL does not respond within this time frame, it is marked as a failure, and the status square will turn red.
